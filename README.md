# Flyable

A NodeJS application intended to be run on a Raspberry Pi. This will query a flight park weather station and return a boolean based on if the current weather conditions are conducive to paragliding. The parameters for what is considered conducive are still a work in progress, so this should by no means be considered a source of truth. Rather, it will give a pilot a rough idea of the conditions, so they can continue with deeper research.
